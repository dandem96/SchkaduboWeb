<!-- About Harambe -->
<p style="font-size:150%"> On May 28, 2016, an innocent 17-year-old hard working, peaceful, studious, and lets be honest ... monarchist Western lowland gorilla, Harambe was shot in cold blood, or as my palace zoologist always reminded me, warm blood, in the case of gorillas.
</p>

<p style="font-size:150%"> Of course, Harambe's fame means that I dont need to explain his importance to you. But, the whole world must remember him, because if people start forgeting those who have gone far far away, how will my people remember me, a deposed king. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:150%"> Remember: Pray for Harambe

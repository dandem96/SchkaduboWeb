<p style="font-size:150%" style="text-align:left">Humble Beginings: </p>
<p style="font-size:120%" style="text-align:left">Oyo-Uson was little more than a backwater duchy through the early 20th century. 
Our people were harrassed by neighbors which the Nigerian Emperors, good friends of our dynasty, were unable to subdue.
These included the Sea People in the east and the the Ma-uwa and Hanisdan tribes in the west. 
My grandfather, Haushan Schkadubo, defeated the enemies of Uson, and incorporated the Ma-uwa and Hanisdan tribes into the duchy.
In return for defeating the troublemakers, Haushan Schkadubo was crowned King Haushan I, and Uyo-Uson was elevated to kingdom status in the Nigerian Empire by then-Emperor Nnamdi Azikiwe.
</p>
<p style="font-size:150%" style="text-align:left">Rise to Greatness: </p>
<p style="font-size:120%" style="text-align:left">Oyo-Uson developed like no other West African kingdom in the 20th century. 
Great industries from paperboard manufacturing to petroleum processing called Uyo-Uson home.  
The great palace was renovated in 1991 with all the modern comforts, plumbing and electricity, even a backup diesel generator. 
By 2000, literacy had risen to 55% and tax revenues revenues exceeded 250,000,000 Nigerian Naira.
</p>
<p style="font-size:150%" style="text-align:left">Internal Reforms: </p>
<p style="font-size:120%" style="text-align:left">With all this money, I decided to build an array of great works.
A new Ministry of State Affairs was created to do anything I wished from siphoning education funds into foreign bank accounts to fighting the Nigerian Mafia's grip on our cigar trade.
To fight corruption, all public servants recieved a pay raise of 10 Naira per month and rotated ministries every 6 months.  
</p>
<p style="font-size:150%" style="text-align:left">Growing Troubles: </p>
<p style="font-size:120%" style="text-align:left">Like many other nations, Uyo-Uson was deeply affected by the economic crisis of 2008-09. 
Our kingdom was especially impacted by the following unfortunate disaster.
In 2010, following my magnificent coronation, state funds were invested into a Bitcoin mining operation. 
After digging through 500,000 tons of soil and stone, nothing was found besides 20 old coins, a plow, and my great-great-grandfather's tomb.
This disasterous investment put us under a great deal of financial pressure, but we survived, barely. 
</p>
<p style="font-size:150%" style="text-align:left">The Great Kerfuffle: </p>
<p style="font-size:120%" style="text-align:left">In 2013, we were hit by the greatest threat to our nation ever. 
An army led by disaffected civil servants, bloggers, and a former oligarch was trained in nearby Huusutua.
They aimed to establish a rebublic and successfully forced me to leave my palace. 
The disaster could have been avoided had the whole of the Nigerian Empire not had to deal with the threat of Boko-Harem at the same time. 
However, as Boko-Harem had captured the northern duchies, beloved Emperor Goodluck Jonathan was not able to offer his usual assistance. 
Today liberal anarchy has reduced the quality of our paperboard products and the prosperity of our people.
